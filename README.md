Diabetes is a fast-growing disease among people, even among youngsters. In understanding diabetes and how it develops, we need to understand what happens in the body without diabetes. Sugar (glucose) comes from the foods that we eat, specifically carbohydrate foods. Carbohydrate foods provide our body with its main energy source. Everybody, even those people with diabetes, needs carbohydrates. Carbohydrate foods include bread, cereal, pasta, rice, fruit, dairy products and vegetables (especially starchy vegetables). When we eat these foods, the body breaks them down into glucose. The glucose moves around the body in the bloodstream. Some of the glucose is taken to our brain to help us think clearly and function. The remainder of the glucose is taken to the cells of our body for energy and to our liver, where it is stored as energy that is used later by the body. For the body to use glucose for energy, insulin is required. Insulin is a hormone that is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin works like a key to a door. Insulin attaches itself to doors on the cell, opening the door to allow glucose to move from the bloodstream, through the door, and into the cell. If the pancreas is not able to produce enough insulin (insulin deficiency) or if the body cannot use the insulin it produces (insulin resistance), glucose builds up in the bloodstream (hyperglycemia) and diabetes develops. Diabetes Mellitus means high levels of sugar (glucose) in the bloodstream and in the urine.

# Features


# Requirements
Operating System Compatibility: The system should be compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS environments to ensure accessibility across different platforms.
Programming Language: Development should be conducted using Python 3.6 or later versions to leverage its extensive libraries and ecosystem.
Libraries: Required libraries include Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow for deep learning, NLTK and TextBlob for natural language processing, as well as API libraries for accessing market data.
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Used Colab Notebook for efficient development and experimentation.
Methodology
Data Collection: Gather intraday stock price data from reliable sources, ensuring completeness and consistency for subsequent analysis and modeling.
Preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies, and perform data normalization to prepare the dataset for further analysis.
EDA: Explore the dataset to gain insights, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between variables using statistical and visual techniques.
Model Development: Design an appropriate model architecture, such as LSTM, for intraday stock price prediction, considering features and target variable.
Training and Evaluation: Train the model using the prepared dataset, validate its performance using suitable metrics, and fine-tune parameters for optimal results.
